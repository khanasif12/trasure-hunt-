I (Munawar Bijani) did write this game mostly on my own; however I quickly found I did not have enough knowledge to finish it. I would like to thank Ameer Armaly for being the one who actually got me started; after the 2.50 release I knew I wanted enemy interactivity, but didn't know where to start. Armaly really helped me through this one; he wrote about 10% of the actual code which I later finished. I seriously couldn't have done it without him, thanks man!

Next I want to thank both Stephen Clower and Daniel Zingaro for giving me pointers. Once about 40% of the coding was done, I again ran into a roadblock, one which caused my system to hang, another which just simply wouldn't work--- both these people gave me pointers. I love the way Dan informed me: "Dan, how would I do this?" "You need..." I admire you, Dan, for not giving me the answer and instead showing me a door. This, in fact, allowed me to be proud of my work more since I coded nearly the whole thing, with the exception of Ameer who as I stated earlier was my spark for this project (Treasure Hunt > 2.50.)

And of course SW, for starting me off with DX! Rock on!

One more person who I would like to extend the most gratitude towards is Philip Bennefall (http://www.pb-games.com/). This guy is clearly a blessing to me from God. Without him, TH would have no sound whatsoever! He also created the Treasure Hunt trailer which can be listened to by clicking Start\Programs\The BPCPrograms Software Division\Treasure Hunt Trailer! Rock on man! Also, Bennefall and I worked together to put the Treasure Hunt storyline into audio, with Bennefall doing literally 95% of the work; and he asks for nothing in return! I mean it man, you rock 100%!

Another person to whom I would like to extend much gratitude is Kelly John Sapergia. This individual was my musician and has done an excelent job for me! You may visit his website at:
http://www.kjsproductions.com. I had run into some copyright issues with TH 3 and it was Mr. Sapergia who came to my rescue! Really, you helped so much in the success of TH I can't express it in words!

Without these people none of this TH business would have existed today :-)! O, and another thing, Ameer and I were the only ones who knew of this game being developed; we were not going to tell anyone about it until it's done and I thank Ameer for not slipping on this; you are noble! In addition, Ameer wrote the readme file for TH <= 2.50---this took a lot of work off my chest :-)!

***1: Introduction
As he descends the steps to the underground base, James is concerned with the project's completion. He knows what he is going to do, but how he will do it is a different story. Going over all the chemicals in his backpack, James stops dead in his descent. As he stands there pondering over this experiment, he remembers his professor once saying to him, "James, you will become an excelent cloner; maybe you should pursue it. I'll give you some resources."

Ahh, if only he knew where the books were! "Aha! there!" exclaims James aloud, "right under my nose and I didn't notice them?"

A broad grin spreads over his face as he kneels down and opens a door built into the staircase and grabs his books---"hmmm... ok, so I've got a mouse already, good,... I need..." He then realizes all this time he had the items to clone with him, he was just being a dumb jerk and had not noticed it.

After reaching solid ground, james begins to walk north: on his right he passes a door. The second one he opens to an eastwest corridor. "Here I am, Jackson, give me the key."
"Very well, here you go, sir."
He then walks toward the Northeast corner of his base where the panel is located; after entering the code, he walks over to the vault in which he keeps the card which starts the cloning machine. Taking it, he goes back to the panel and inserts it. The machine begins to hum and Brutus smiles to himself as he watches it do its job.

AT THE FBI:
"Sir, we have learned of an individual by the name of James Brutus who apparently has been accused of performing some ill experiment in his laboratory: when his guests try to converse with him, he is short tempered and some say he spends days at a time in his lab. We are, unfortunately, forced to break into his house and if circumstances lead to it, gain access to his personal data."

"Great, when will I be set off on this search?"

"Be patient, sir, let me tell you your mission first. You will be required to search his house, that is first on my list; from there, I shall give you exact directions."

AT BRUTUS'S HOUSE
Entering Brutus's house you notice the ordinary---papers, coffee table, Etc. A kitchen is to your left and the hallway leading to the bedrooms is to your right. You can hear the air conditioner humming softly in the background. As you scrutinize the area, however, you notice a rectangular opening in the floor. kneeling down and placing your gun in a position which will allow you to grab it instantly should you need to defend yourself, you beam your flashlight through the hole. Almost at once, you find yourself under 3 guards, who are slugging you horribly. As you struggle to get up you notice a team of fighters come to your aid; battling off the guards, they hoist you up and take you back to the FBI.

THE MISSION STATEMENT
"Very well sir, the flashlight image you took of Brutus's base is exactly what we need. Unfortunately though you alerted Brutus to the fact that the FBI is after him. We have monitored him closely the past three days and have noticed that he has set his guards on high alert. Here is a card which holds a document which I have written. It explains in detail your mission."

You slip the card into a slot on the back of the Audient. It begins to read the data on the card.
"Munawar, as thus your mission is to stop the machine at all costs. If it does do what Brutus has set it to do, serious consequences may result. You must validate your insertion of the key into the vault---Brutus requires valid authorization for this thence none but himself may unlock the vault. Secondly, you must find the key. It's located in a chest which requires validation to open; thence you must validate it first via the control panel, then open the chest and get the key. Once you have the key, Munawar, the next part of your mission is dangerous. You must get to the vault at all costs, unlock it, and get the card. This card will then need to be slipped into the panel to shut off the machine. This will also lower the shield. After this, blow up the machine so that none may use it again. Be careful though: when off, the machine alternately activates an extremely powerful camra which in turn is attached to several explosives. If you do get spotted, you're history. Therefore, do whatever you can to blow it up, but don't get too close. Stay away from it!

The machine will take a while to shut off because of all the electric it uses: every circuit is shut off after a sufficient gap in between, so be patient and it will turn off after about one minute.

Also there is a weaponry available. There are some useful weapons there from what we can see, one of which you will definitely need in your mission. The door though is locked. You'll have to find the key to it. Once you get it open, take advantage of that room. We believe that the door to the panel is also locked for security purposes, though we are not sure. It may be unlocked: from what we can see, both locks use the same key. Brutus also uses a private transport system to occasionally restock his supply room. From the stairs, there will be a door all the way to your right. This door leads to a North South corridor. At the end of this corridor is the supply room. We shall be notifying you when it restocks.

Another thing, it appears that the vault is surrounded by mine fields.. Brutus uses a hidden passageway to get under the mines. We can't detect it. However, the mine control center is monitoring the mines. If you blow it up, you should be able to get past. We don't know what's under the mines, but whatever it is you should be able to get past it, just get rid of those mines.

The Audient, the tool from which you are reading the data on this card, is your GPS. From this, an ear piece is attached to your ear thence none but you may hear what it dictates. It fits easily into your uniform's pocket. From the panel on the Audient, you will be able to get your barings, the barings of the vault, control panel, and chest. The scope range on the Audient is 20 feet. When you are in danger of being spotted by a guard, the Audient will sound a red alert signal. A more alarming red alert signal will sound when you are spotted. When danger lurks behind, the Audient will sound a high-pitched beep. Likewise, if danger lurks in front, in case you are blinded for any reason, the Audient will sound a low-pitched beep.

Another feature of the Audient is it's Telecommunications Sound System, or TSS. With the TSS, we shall have audio communication with you. We shall be guiding you through your mission via this device.

The validation code you must enter into the panel is kill all! die!"...

"Ahh, good. Will I be getting any assistance?"

"Nay, none but your Audient and the TSS."

"hmmm. How well-trained are the guards?"

"Know this: All guards have gone through training which has dramatically increased their reflects, skills in shooting, Etc. Be warned, also, that they are equipped with bombs which they will kill you with if you piss them off---therefore it is recommended you stay low."

"Do you have any idea as to where the chest and panel are located?"

"We know of the panel; it's located in the Northeast corner of Brutus's base. As for the vault and chest, we were not able to get their exact bearings."

"We all depend on you, sir. good luck!"

AT BRUTUS'S HOUSE
Again you find yourself at the house of the massive insane cloner Brutus. You enter and start to descend the steps to the underground base. You stop when you hear a blood-curddling scream from an---animal? Who knows? You take a deep breath: "OK, I must do this---he should not be cloning like this, I shall defeat him!"

You check your gun, Audient, and sword; everything seems to be working very well. Taking one last deep breath you climb down the rest of the steps.

When you reach the bottom and are on solid ground, you find yourself in a long eastwest corridor, with a door in front of you. You get a feeling of being trapped: "What if Brutus decides to blow up this place?"

You arm yourself with your gun, and scan the area. It's surprisingly quiet now considering what's going on.

Welcome to Treasure Hunt! This game places the player in an area in which the player must accomplish his goals; along the way, you will encounter enemies which will attempt to kill you.
Accomplishing your mission is not that easy; the area is very wide, you have enemies to worry about, and more! This game is written by Munawar Bijani and portions of it are written by Ameer Armaly.

**1.1: Requirements
In order to successfully run TH, you must have DirectX 8 or later. This tool can be obtained from:
http://www.microsoft.com/directx/
In addition, you must have the Visual Basic 6 Runtime Libraries which can be downloaded from our site under "Utilities" on the navigation bar:
http://www.bpcprograms.tk

***2: Gameplay
Your sole mission and goal is to destroy the machine (for mission clarification, please review the storyline.)

**2.1: Moving Around
Use the Up, Down, Right and Left Arrow keys (UDRL keys) to move in the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West respectively.) You will not need to move South-Southeast, Etc. If a wall blocks your path, you will not be able to move in that direction. When you move, you will interact with whatever you come to (swords, bullets, etc.) All items (if appropriate) will be obtained automatically. To find out the location of the vault, chest and control panel, press T.

*2.1.1: Looking
Your Audient, as discussed in the storyline, comes with a scope which has a range of twenty feet. To use it, hold down the Shift key as you press a UDRL key. If there is nothing in the twenty foot range, you will hear the Audient say "nothing," otherwise, it will notify you what the beam has landed on, and how far away it is.

**2.2: Enemy Interactivity
To kill a guard, you must be on his sector. The audient will sound a siren when you are in danger of being spotted; if you do get spotted, you will hear the battle music start and the guard will begin shooting.

*2.2.1: Battle Commands
The Spacebar is the action button in TH; pressing Space will use whatever weapon you have active at the moment. To toggle between your weapons, press the numbers on the number row. You will be told to what weapon you toggled and you may now use that weapon by pressing Space.

**2.3: Weapons
TH has various weapons you may use throughout your mission. In this section we shall discuss each weapon and how to use it. To purchase amunition for a weapon, first toggle to that weapon, then press b. The units of amunition you receive varies depending on how much is contained within a cartrige of that weapon. Every unit of amunition is five points.

*2.3.1: Poisoned Needles
These needles are used to poison and slowly kill a guard. The more needles with which you hit a guard, the quicker the poison will react and the quicker the guard will die. You must be no more than ten feet south of the guard to successfully hit him; also, you cannot be on his sector when you throw a needle at him. Both Brutus and his experiment show some resistance toward the poison and although it is nice to know that they are slowing dying, it is unwise to solely depend on the poison to kill them. This weapon is assigned a number of 3 on the numbers row.

*2.3.2: Gun
You are armed with a gun when you start your mission. This weapon is assigned a number of 1 on the numbers row. To use it, press Spacebar. The standard unit of amunition for this weapon is 10.

*2.3.3: Sword
You are also armed with a sword. This sword may be used in battle. The sword is not recommended to be used in battle since it does have a chance of slightly missing the target. It should only be used if no explosive device or stronger weapon is readily available. This weapon is assigned a number 2 on the numbers row.

*2.3.4: Laser Gun
The laser gun is a weapon you must find and pick up. (Read the storyline for clues on the location of this weapon.) The laser almost always kills its target and it is strongly recommended to face Brutus with this weapon. 

*2.3.5: Remote Controled Missile Launcher
This weapon is a complex tool: out of the launcher is ejected a missile that is remotely controled. You must guide this missile to its target. While you are guiding a remote missile, the UDRL keys do not have their original functionality. The Uparow key increases the missile's speed, while the Downarrow decreases its speed. The Left and Rightarrow keys are used to turn the missile. When you turn the missile, the new direction in which the missile is headed will be announced. Every missile starts off going north. Every beep from the remote indicates the missile has moved one latitude or longitude, whichever is appropriate. Once the missile has been launched, there is no way to stop it unless it contacts another object whereupon it will explode, or is blown up by other means which you will discover throughout your mission. There will be times when you cannot hear the missile at all, because it is too far away. It is thus required in this situation to rely solely on your Audient and the beep from the remote.

When a remote controled missile is in action, in addition to the regular UDRL keys having different functions, Shift+UDRL also has a different function. It still, however, allows one to look ahead, but it is now in view of the missile, not the player. Also, the T key gives direction information in terms of the launched missile, not the player.

If the missile hits something, it will explode; the player is also strongly advised to avoid passing the missile right in front of guards as they will shoot it if they see it. To detinate the missile, press Spacebar. This key will also launch the missile.

Note: The only time the direction of the Mine Control Center or Cloning Machine will be announced is when the missile is in the air; otherwise, T will not give this information.

*2.3.6: Bullet Reflector
Bullet Reflectors do just as their name implies : they protect the player from danger. All gunshots from the guards are perished by the shield. Note, however, bullet reflectors will not save you from mine fields. The energy is too great, and the reflector will crack, causing you to die instantly. The shield of a bullet reflector lasts about thirty seconds, and you are virtually imortal during this period.

*2.3.7: Mental Capacity Breacher
The Mental Capacity Breacher (MCB) is restricted to registered users only. This weapon, although handled like a gun, does not act as one. Instead, it is an enchantment weapon. Through the use of the MCB, the player may gain full control over a guard's mind for approximately sixty seconds; the spell breaks when the guard loses his life. During your hold on the guard, you may lead him anywhere, and even make him shoot other guards. This weapon comes with 100 shots and no more: you cannot buy amunition for this weapon as you would the Bullet Reflectors or other weapons.

*2.3.7.1: Usage
To gain control of a guard, you must be standing no more than twenty feet south of him. You cannot be on a guard's sector when firing this weapon. You will hear the spell hit the guard if it does succeed; at this point, you are the guard. During this enchantment, you may move the guard as you would your player. Toggling to any other weapon will hault the enchantment, leaving the guard dumbstriken: you may then guide your player. Toggling back to the MCB will allow you to move the guard once more.

*2.3.7.2: Commands
Use the four arrows keys to move the guard; press R to force the guard to stand on your sector (this is useful if you are using the guard as your assistant.) Press Enter to force the guard to open a door.

**2.4: Swimming
Throughout your mission, you will be required to swim to various objects. When underwater, your health will start to decrease due to the holding of breath; you may come up in a treading position to rest and regain your health before diving underwater again. Below 10 feet, it is difficult for guards to spot you; you can remain hidden from them this way. 

*2.4.1: Swimming Concepts And Commands
To swim North, press the action button (Spacebar.) Likewise, to swim South, press Shift+Spacebar. To swim upward, press Up Arrow and to swim Downward, press Down Arrow. Swimming left and right is done by using the Left and Right Arrow keys respectively. When your health is low, repeatedly press Up Arrow to break the surface and rest. While in rest mode, you cannot swim; instead, Spacebar will use whatever weapon you have active and Shift+Spacebar does nothing. While in rest mode, your health is slowly regained. To dive back in the water and continue swimming, press Down Arrow.

When you have not swam for a while your depth will begin to increase. This is not good since you will have more depth to cover when coming up to rest should your health reach a dangerously low level.

**2.5: Saving/Loading a Game
Saving and loading games can be done one of two ways: either press Ctrl+S or Ctrl+L, or use the "File" menu to access these options. Enter a slot number from 1 to 3. This will be the slot from which you will later load that game. 

**2.6: Passages and Doors
When you arrive at a passage, you will be able to hear the wind howling through the passage. When you are near a door, your audient will alert you of it. To open a door, stand next to it and press Enter. You may also close doors in this manner.

Treasure Hunt has both corridors and rooms, The difference between the two is that a corridor is a hallway, and a room is a wide open area with a door to go in and out.

*2.6.1: Opening and Closing Doors
When you arive at a closed door, the Audient will sound a continuous notification to alert you of it. To open a door, you must stand next to it (no more than one foot away.) Press Enter. The door will slide open at which point you may walk through. To close a door, perform the same steps. Be careful that you do not close the door on yourself: this will cause you to get hurt and eventually lose. For a door to be opened and closed, it must be unlocked.

*2.6.1.1: Locking and Unlocking Doors
Locking a door will prevent a guard from opening the door. Also, throughout your mission you will be required to unlock locked doors to admit you into a vital room. To lock or unlock a door, stand no more than one foot away from it and press Shift+Enter. You must have the Master Key to do this (press I to find out if you have this key or otherwise.)

**2.6: Difficulty Levels
The player may choose from four difficulty levels. This option will be presented after selecting the "start new game" option from the main menu. The Easy difficulty functions in-step with Treasure Hunt 4.00. The Moderate difficulty is slightly more challenging, but at a reasonable pace. The Impossible difficulties is where TH gets more challenging than the 4.00 release. On the Impossible difficulty, the guards have more intelegence; they will search for you: usually one can simply stand in one spot and not get spotted; however, on the Impossible difficulty, the guards will scrutinize the whole corridor, and walk into adjoining corridors if needed.
